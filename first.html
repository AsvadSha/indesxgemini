**Things to note:**

* This code provides the basic structure with HTML. You'll need to create a separate CSS file (`style.css`) to style the elements with colors, fonts, and layouts.
* The menu section only lists a few items. You can expand on this with more drinks and food options.
* The checkout section is a simple form with radio buttons for payment methods. You'll need additional logic (likely with Javascript) to handle actual payment processing.

This is a starting point for your Acafei website. Remember to style it with CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience!
